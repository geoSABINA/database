# geoSABINA: a unified ecological database for Spain

## Overview

TThe geoSABINA dataframe provides a comprehensive, easy to use, and spatially-explicit database to support ecological research and planning in mainland Spain. It integrates high-resolution spatial layers across four key collections: 
a) Plants occurrence records: include precise and refined location records for 82 tree and 101 shrub native species, as well as atlas of distribution for 6,456 vascular plants and XXX bryophytes
b) Environmental variables: encompass climatic, edaphic, hydrological, and solar exposure factors at 250-meter resolution
c) Species distribution models: employ a spatially-nested hierarchical approach with sabinaNSDM package for trees and shrubs
d) Thematic maps to guide conservation: including 1) biodiversity maps measuring woody and protected plant species richness, 2)  the distribution of the main vegetation types, and 3) the importance of patches and corridors to promote forest connectivity. 

The climatic variables, the species distribution models, and the thematic maps are projected both under current and four scenarios of future climate conditions (2070-2100).

The geoSABINA database is openly available on Zenodo (LINK).

Here we provide the R-code allowing to reproduce the environmental variable download, the species distribution modelling, the thematic maps creation, and the technical validation of the resulting maps.
